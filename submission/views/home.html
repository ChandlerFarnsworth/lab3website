        <p>Hello! I'm Chandler Farnsworth, a passionate web enthusiast and developer. 
        I love bringing creative ideas to life through coding and exploring new technologies.</p>
        <p>With a strong background in computer science and digital marketing, I have developed a unique skill set that blends technical expertise with strategic thinking. At the University of Colorado Boulder, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, complemented by my experience in business and marketing from founding CLF Marketing. I specialize in web development, digital strategy, and problem-solving, and I enjoy working on projects that create meaningful impact.</p>
        <p>Previously, I led a team for Sko Serve, tackling food insecurity in South Dakota by managing logistics, outreach, and partnerships. At Aveo Capital, I modernized their online presence and significantly reduced web management costs. These experiences have honed my ability to lead teams, drive innovative solutions, and adapt to different industries.</p>
        <p>My technical skills include Python, Java, C++, MySQL, and front-end web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Additionally, I am proficient in Adobe Photoshop and DaVinci Resolve, allowing me to integrate design with development effectively.</p>
